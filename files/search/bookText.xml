                           Get ready.

                           Read about Judy’s vacation and write True (T), False
                           (F) or Not Mentioned (NM). Then correct the false
                           sentences.


                           My favorite trip was the one I took to Italy. I visited Rome,
                           Venice, and Florence. I visited museums, went sightseeing,
                           and ate delicious food. I also visited many monuments,
                           famous churches, and squares. All the cities I visited were
                           very beautiful and the people were very sociable.
                           I think Rome is my favorite historical city. Imagine what it
                           was like 2,000 years ago.

                            I hope I can go back there again one day.






                                                 This big building is the Coliseum.
                                                 In my opinion, it’s a fantastic
                                                 old monument.



                                                     This is the “Ponte Vecchio” or “Old Bridge”
                                                     in English. This bridge is famous for
                                                     the many jewelry stores that you find
                                                     along it. I’m not into jewelry so I didn’t
                                                     buy anything. But the bridge is beautiful,
                                                     of course.




                                                 I visited many churches in Rome, but
                                                 Saint Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City is
                                                 simply incredible. Did you know that
                                                 Vatican City is actually a country
                                                 inside Rome?




                                                              When I was in Venice I had
                                                              to take a gondola ride, of
                                                              course.





                   1.     Judy went to Italy on her last vacation.    6.     Judy doesn’t think the food in Italy is very good.
                   2.     Her trip to Italy was her favorite vacation.  7.   Rome, Venice, and Florence are near each other.
                   3.     In Judy’s opinion, Italians are very shy.   8.     Judy rode a gondola.
                   4.     Judy visited three cities in Italy.         9.     Judy bought a lot of jewelry.
                   5.     There is a country called Vatican City inside Rome.  10.   She liked the sights in Florence.

                          Charles Darwin, naturalist and geologist, was born on February 12,
                           1809 in the United Kingdom. His father was a doctor. Unfortunately,
                           his mother died when he was only eight years old.
                           When Darwin was 16, he went to a university to study
                           medicine, but he didn’t like it. What he liked was to study
                           and collect insects. He even published his findings about

                           it in a book.
                           Then, in 1831, Darwin went on an expedition aboard a
                           ship called the Beagle. He traveled the world for about
                            five years. During this time he collected, studied, and
                            catalogued information that helped him create one of the
                            most important theories in the history of science 20 years
                            later. The theory was the theory of evolution, in which he
                            explained how living creatures evolved, and he published

                            it in his book On the Origin of Species.
                            Darwin died on April 19, 1882 and he was buried at
                             Westminster Abbey close to Sir Issac Newton.

                      So, Yuji, did you ﬁ nish your
                      science project ye erday?  Yes, I did. But I... ju        Hello?
                                               a second, Jean Luc.
























                                              Hey, there! What
                                            happened? Why didn’t                 I’m sorry to hear that. Don’t
                                             you come to sch l?                 worry. I’ll tell the teachers. I
                                                                                hope you get better s n. Bye.


















                             Who was it, Yuji?                                      That’s t  bad.

                                               It was A.J.











                             What’s the
                               matter?
                                            He has a cold.

                                                                                       Well, he went to the doctor

                      What do you do when you have a cold, a sore throat, or a headache? Do you see
                      a doctor? Take a pain reliever? Self-medicate? Well, I hope you don’t do the last
                      one.
                      If your body is a victim of a mild health problem, why don’t you try a simple
                      home remedy?
                      In the past home remedies were the only option because people didn’t have
                      medicines produced by companies like they do today.
                      Even now, though, some people still prefer a more natural solution to their
                      health problems. They use remedies they learned from their grandparents,
                      for example. After all, home remedies are often passed from generation to
                      generation.
                      Here are some things I learned from my grandparents. When I have a…
                      •  headache: a massage with rosemary oil on the temple and forehead helps a
                         lot. Also a little nap in a dark silent room;
                      •  stomachache: drink a lot of water. Warm herbal tea works for me, too,
                         especially mint tea;
                      •  backache: I have a hot water bottle that I can heat in the microwave. I just lie
                         down on it. Stretching is very good, too;
                      •  sore throat: nothing works better for me than ginger tea. I also have a
                         teaspoon of honey three times during the day;
                      •  cold: I drink warm milk with honey and garlic and go straight to bed.
                      Maybe you would like to try my remedies when you have a mild health problem.

                        1.    A:   I have a  ______________________________________________ .
                              B:   Why don’t you have some honey?

                              B:   You can use this hot water bottle and lie down a little.

                           Get ready.
                           Read and answer the questions.

                           Teens are divorcing the mall

                           It seems incredible, but the love affair between
                           teens and malls may be over.
                           According to a recent report by Piper Jaffray Co.,
                           teens are visiting the mall 28 times per year. This is
                           30% less than in 2007, for example.
                           The report also speculates about the reasons. One
                           of the reasons is that the mall isn’t the best place to
                           shop anymore. Teens are browsing the web to find
                           and buy products. This makes them less excited to
                           go see these products at the mall.

                           On top of that, teens don’t need the mall for
                           entertainment anymore. They spend a lot of their
                           time now connected to their social networks, which
                           is entertaining and free. And when they do hang out,
                           they prefer places like restaurants and diners.
                           Malls are trying to come up with strategies to
                           change this scenario, but it seems this tendency isn’t
                           going to change.


                           1.   What is the main idea of the article?

                                 Teens love going to malls.
                                 Teens prefer shopping at the mall to
                                 shopping online.
                                 Teens aren’t hanging out at malls as
                                 frequently as before.


                           2.   Read the article again. Underline two reasons
                              why teens are abandoning malls.

                           3.   In your opinion, where do teens like hanging out?

                     The secrets of                 Four weeks before the party:   Day before the party:

                     party planning                 Pick a date and time.          Prepare the food that can be
                                                                                   pre-heated.

                     Planning a party is simple, but
                     there are important things you
                     need to pay attention to if you   Plan the entertainment: music,
                     want your party to be a huge   games, etc.                    Remove fragile objects (if the
                     success.                                                      party is at your place).
                                                                                   Move the furniture to make some
                     Important questions:                                          space (if the party is at your
                                                                                   place).
                     What are we celebrating?
                     Sometimes, the reason for the
                     party will determine lots of
                     things.                        Two weeks before the party:
                                                    Prepare your shopping list and   Day of the party:
                     How many people are coming?    check if it will ﬁ t your budget.
                     Where is the party going to be?   Order the cake. (In case it’s a   Pick up the cake.
                     When you are planning a party,   birthday party!)
                     size matters. The place needs to                              Blow up the balloons and ﬁ nish
                     be adequate for the number of   Conﬁ rm with your friends if they   the decorations.
                     people you will invite.        can really help you.

                                                    The week before the party:     Do the last-minute cooking (if
                                                                                   necessary).

                              That was so lame.          That was epic!          It was a nightmare.
